# ðŸ§® Matrix-Vector Dot Product â€“ Deep-ML Problem 1

This repository contains my solution for [Deep-ML Problem 1](https://www.deep-ml.com/problems/1), which involves computing the dot product between a matrix and a vector. It's one of my first steps into solving ML/math-related coding problems using Python.

## ðŸ“Œ Problem Statement

Given:
- A matrix `a` as a list of lists
- A vector `b` as a list

You need to return:
- A list containing the dot product of each row in the matrix `a` with the vector `b`, if their dimensions are compatible.
- Otherwise, return `-1`.
